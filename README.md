This Is An Overview Of My Lido Trap

This repository contains an implementation of a Drosera trap designed to monitor Lidoâ€™s stETH supply changes on the Hoodi testnet. The trap listens for supply growth events (minting / reward issuance) and determines whether it should respond by instructing a responder contract to forward a small portion of detected rewards to a partner protocol, forming an incentive feedback loop.

The trap is composed of two main components:

Trap Contract A Solidity smart contract that integrates with Droseraâ€™s runtime. It defines the logic for identifying supply growth on the stETH contract by sampling totalSupply() across blocks. The contract exposes a shouldRespond function, which compares previous and current supply samples and decides whether a response is required, and a collect function, which returns the sampled block number and supply for analysis and encoding when conditions are met.

Drosera Configuration A TOML configuration file that defines the trap path, response contract, and environment variables. This file is used to bootstrap the trap and connect it to the Drosera runtime for testing and deployment, and specifies the response_function (e.g., respondWithIncentive(uint256)) used to forward the encoded incentive amount to the partner.

Purpose

The trap enables developers to simulate, observe, and test automated incentive forwarding triggered by Lido reward events in a controlled testnet environment. It is particularly useful for:

Tracking stETH supply increases as a proxy for reward issuance
Validating how automated responders can capture and redirect a share of new rewards
Experimenting with Droseraâ€™s trap lifecycle, cooldowns, and gas usage when creating a feedback loop

Results

When deployed with Droseraâ€™s dryrun, the trap reports gas usage for collect and shouldRespond functions, along with information about sampled block numbers, supply deltas, and the encoded response payload (the incentive amount). These results help confirm that the trap identifies reward events correctly and that the responder can forward the intended incentive share to the partner.
